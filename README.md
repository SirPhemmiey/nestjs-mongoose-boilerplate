## Description

Personal [Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) boilierplate to kick-start a new project right off the bat! This is hooked up with MongoDB as the database and Mongoose for the ORM. Because it's a simple boilerplate, only the login endpoint works.

The goal and intention is for it to be simple to use and worked around. I'll be writing up boilerplates with Sequelize, Prisma and TypeORM in the future.

$ yarn install
